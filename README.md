# Hack-O-Holic
## Application security for Aadhar Portal

All credentials like passwords and such are hashed using SHA256 encryption/decryption.

Here These encrypted hashed data is processed through Salting .
Salting is a method of adding random bits to each password instance before its hashing.
An otp is sent to the user if he/she wants his/her aadhar details to be updated.
In case he/she forgets the password / The 2FA will be enforced.
